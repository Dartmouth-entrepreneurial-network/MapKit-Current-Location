This blank Swift 2 app shows the characteristic blue dot of the user's location. A commented gist which explains the code of ViewController.swift is available [here](https://gist.github.com/SamPutnam/46723b38c904fda25df5209e40ca3852). It runs on an iPhone 6 in the simulator, or on an iPhone 6 in your hand deployed from Xcode Version 7.3.1. It prints latitude and longitude coordinates and a timestamp from the last location update to the Xcode console.
